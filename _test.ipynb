(: \"Bread and Circuses\")In Orion Press continuity, the planet was called \"Tellus\" and System 892 had the Bayer classification of Beta Hydrae. It had been speculated that the planet's inhabitants had been transplanted from Earth by the Preservers 2,500 years before. (Orion Press: \"The Return\", TOS novel: Ex Machina)By the late 24th century, the Magna Romans had joined the Federation. (TNG novel: The Captains' Honor)\n",

    " - abstract: 892-IV was the inhabited fourth planet of the 892 system. Classified as M-class, the planet was orbited by two moons and was the homeworld of the 892-IV natives, a pre-warp humanoid species.As Commander Spock, science officer of the USS Enterprise, noted, 892-IV had a striking resemblance to Earth. However, as much as there were similarities, there were differences. The proportion of land to water, density (5.5g), and atmosphere (78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen) were exactly like those on Earth. However, unlike Earth, the diameter at the equator (7,917 miles) and layout of the continents were different. (: \"\")\n",

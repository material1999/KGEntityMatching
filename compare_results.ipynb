      "http://starwars.wikia.com/Anakin_Skywalker\n",
      "{'abstract': [\"Anakin Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic, a hero of the Clone Wars, and the Chosen One of the Force. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, he was known as Darth Vader, Sith Lord and apprentice to Emperor Darth Sidious. Skywalker was born in 41 BBY, forty-one years before the Battle of Yavin, on the planet Tatooine in the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy. Although he had a mother, Shmi Skywalker, there was no father involved in his conception. This revelation caused Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn to suspect that Skywalker had been conceived by the midi-chlorians. After liberating Skywalker from slavery, Jinn brought him to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for training but the Jedi High Council deemed the boy too old and ruled by his emotions to become a Jedi. Following the Battle of Naboo, however, the High Council reversed their decision in light of the revelation that their ancient foes, the Sith, had returned. Despite the reservations of Grand Master Yoda, Skywalker became the Padawan of Jinn's former apprentice, the newly-promoted Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi.As a Jedi, Skywalker progressed faster than the other apprentices but his Master deemed him headstrong and impatient, resulting in a degree of friction between teacher and student. By the time of Separatist Crisis, Kenobi felt that Skywalker still had much to learn whereas the latter insisted he was ready to complete the Jedi Trials and become a fully-trained knight of the Jedi Order. With the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, Skywalker's training was deemed complete, allowing him to serve as a Jedi Knight by the time of the Battle of Christophsis. Throughout the conflict, Skywalker led the Grand Army of the Republic alongside his fellow Jedi Generals, and trained his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano. Skywalker did this all the while maintaining a secret relationship with the Naboo senator Padmé Amidala in violation of the Jedi Code, which forbade personal attachments and romantic relationships. His achievements as a battlefield commander earned him the nickname Hero With No Fear; as the conflict progressed, Skywalker became a symbol of the Jedi Order. In 19 BBY, Ahsoka was falsely charged with the bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar. It was eventually revealed that she was innocent, but the incident shook her trust in the Jedi Order. She still trusted Skywalker, but ultimately decided to leave the Jedi Order, which deeply saddened Skywalker. The loss of his apprentice also added to his anger towards the Jedi Council, and this anger would eventually be a major push to the dark side of the Force.By the closing days of the war in 19 BBY, Skywalker was elated by his wife's pregnancy, yet also fearful of losing her as he foresaw Amidala's death in childbirth. As a result, Darth Sidious seduced Skywalker to the dark side of the Force with promises of saving Amidala as well as bringing peace and order to the galaxy. Embracing his new identity as Darth Vader, the fallen Jedi Knight marched on the Temple at the head of the 501st Legion, killing his former comrades on Coruscant while the rest of the Jedi were betrayed by their clone troopers across the galaxy. However, rather than saving his wife, Vader's actions caused Amidala to die of a broken heart. Her death—in addition to severe injuries Vader sustained in his duel with Kenobi on Mustafar, rendering him more machine than man—caused the Sith Lord to all but completely bury Anakin Skywalker beneath the persona of Darth Vader.Vader served his Sith Master for decades; together they consolidated the Empire's control over the galaxy and simultaneously hunted the few surviving Jedi until the Order was all but extinct. Despite his involvement in the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Vader failed to prevent the destruction of the Death Star. Upon learning that the pilot responsible for destroying the superweapon was his son, Luke Skywalker—the child he assumed had died with Amidala—Vader formulated a plot to overthrow the Emperor by turning the nascent Jedi to the dark side. Following the Battle of Hoth, the two confronted each other on Bespin with Vader emerging as the victor of their duel. He beseeched Skywalker to rule the galaxy with him as a family, but the young Jedi rejected his father's offer and rejoined his allies in their fight against the Empire.They confronted each other once more, this time in the presence of the Emperor, during the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. Skywalker was ultimately victorious, but refused to kill his father or take his place at Sidious' side. The Dark Lord of the Sith unleashed his fury against Skywalker, torturing him slowly with torrents of Force lightning. The sight of his son in agony caused the dormant persona of Anakin Skywalker to awaken within Darth Vader and, in a final act of redemption, the apprentice killed the Master at the cost of his own life. Despite Luke's efforts to keep his father alive, at that point all Anakin wanted was to share one last moment with his son before peacefully accepting his death. Having re-embraced the light side of the Force at the time of his demise, Anakin's consciousness was preserved in the form of a Force spirit by his former mentors, Kenobi and Yoda, both of whom had already become one with the Force. During the Rebel celebration on Endor, the immortal souls of Anakin, Kenobi, and Yoda watched over Luke as he celebrated with his friends.Although Anakin Skywalker fulfilled his destiny as the prophesied Chosen One, restoring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith, the prophecy never predicted the end of the dark side. In the decades following the fall of the Empire, Ben Solo—the son of Anakin's daughter, Princess Leia Organa—was seduced to the dark side like his grandfather before him. After destroying Luke's efforts to rebuild the Jedi Order, Solo adopted the identity of Kylo Ren, becoming the Master of the Knights of Ren as well as the apprentice of Supreme Leader Snoke.

The droid used this to clear windows of grime, dirt and digit marks left by installation droids. The CLE-004 unit could polish even a large window in a matter of seconds. Although they commonly accompanied INS-444 droids to ensure newly-installed windows were spotless, CLE-004 droids were often seen working alone on worlds such as Coruscant. Their repulsors allowed them to reach even the tallest buildings in Galactic City.

      "{'abstract': [\"Exar Kun was a Jedi Knight who fell to the dark side, assumed the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith, and waged a destructive war against the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order during the era of the Old Sith Wars. A Human male, Kun was apprenticed to the respected Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas, and in his days as a student he came across forbidden knowledge of the history of the Sith. Extremely confident in his own abilities and naturally quick to anger, Kun was filled with a burning curiosity regarding the Sith, and soon went on his own quest to find out as much as he could. Kun's search led him to the planet Onderon, which had once been ruled by a Sith Lord named Freedon Nadd. With the help of a pair of Nadd's followers, Kun came across Nadd's tomb on Onderon's moon Dxun, and there was confronted with the spirit of the dead Sith himself. Seeing in Kun a potential avenue to regain a physical form, Nadd directed the young Jedi to the ancient Sith homeworld of Korriban. There, Nadd conspired to grievously injure Kun, only healing the man when he accepted the dark side into his heart. Kun's next stop was to the moon Yavin 4, a place with its own Sith history—Kun enslaved the primitive Massassi living there and compelled them to build extensive temple complexes across the forested world. Soon afterward the fully corrupted Kun banished Nadd's spirit, having never trusted the old Sith, and in the process learned of several other nascent dark side users who had learned from Nadd.Seeing Nadd's other apprentices—Satal and Aleema Keto, Tetan nobles who had founded the Krath cult and conquered their native star system—as a threat, Kun set out to destroy them. On Empress Teta, Kun encountered Ulic Qel-Droma, a Jedi Knight who had lost his Master to a Krath attack and had gone undercover within the group to seek revenge. Qel-Droma had been seduced by the dark side himself, and while the two briefly dueled, their battle was ended when the spirit of long-dead Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos appeared to proclaim the two fit to call themselves Sith Lords. Exar Kun was to be the Dark Lord of the Sith, and Qel-Droma his apprentice, and together they resolved to bring a Sith golden age back to the galaxy. Allied with the remnants of the Krath and the Mandalorian warrior clans, Kun and Qel-Droma commenced a bloody war against the Republic starting in 3996 BBY. In the early stages of the conflict, Kun traveled to the Jedi library world of Ossus, murdered the Jedi Keeper of Antiquities, Odan-Urr, and took possession of a rare Sith holocron. Kun then took several prospective Jedi followers back to Yavin 4, where he used the holocron's power to corrupt them and reshape them into his Brotherhood of the Sith. Kun sent his Brotherhood out into the galaxy to kill their Masters and wreak havoc, while he headed to the Republic capital of Coruscant to rescue Qel-Droma, who had been captured after launching an ill-advised attack on the planet.Ever the showman, Kun burst into the Senate Hall in the middle of Qel-Droma's trial for war crimes, murdering Supreme Chancellor Sidrona and setting Qel-Droma free. On his way out, he was confronted by his former Master, Vodo-Siosk Baas—unable to talk the Krevaaki into joining his side, Kun instead unveiled his new invention, the double-bladed lightsaber, and killed Baas in a duel. Distrustful of Aleema Keto, who had been responsible for Qel-Droma's capture, Kun sent her to her death soon afterward, manipulating her into causing a massive supernova in the Cron Cluster that was sure to destroy the planet Ossus. Ahead of the Jedi Order's chaotic evacuation of the doomed planet, Kun and Qel-Droma descended onto Ossus and ransacked the Great Jedi Library for its ancient treasures. While Kun made it in and out with a sizable haul, Qel-Droma got caught in combat, killed his brother, was taken prisoner and stripped of his connection to the Force. Shattered by his brother's death, Qel-Droma switched sides and led the Jedi to Kun's base on Yavin 4. In the ensuing battle, Kun refused to go quietly, conducting an ancient ritual to free his spirit from his mortal form so he could wreak havoc through the cosmos. He did not entirely succeed: while the ritual worked as intended and the Jedi thought him dead, Kun's spirit was trapped on Yavin 4 for the next several millennia.In 11 ABY, the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker established a Jedi training ground on Yavin 4, as he attempted to build a New Jedi Order after the old Order's destruction at the hands of the Galactic Empire. After thousands of years in isolation, Kun attempted to influence Skywalker's apprentices to do his bidding, successfully turning the young Padawan Kyp Durron to the dark side and severely wounding Skywalker. However, the rest of Skywalker's apprentices banded together and, with the help of the long-dead shade of Vodo-Siosk Baas, banished Kun's spirit and finally put an end to his schemes.\"], 'affiliation': ['Jedi_Order/Legends', 'Galactic_Republic/Legends', 'Sith_Empire_(Great_Sith_War)', 'Brotherhood_of_the_Sith'], 'after': ['Revan'], 'afterYears': ['3959'], 'altLabel': ['Dark Man', 'Exar', 'Exar Kun'], 'apprentices': ['Jorak_Uln', 'Zona_Luka', 'Oss_Wilum', 'Ulic_Qel-Droma', 'Kyp_Durron', 'Gantoris'], 'before': ['Freedon_Nadd'], 'beforeYears': ['4400'], 'bg': ['Екзар Кун'], 'cs': ['Exar Kun'], 'de': ['Exar Kun'], 'death': ['3996', '11'], 'defa': ['1'], 'el': ['Έξαρ Κουν'], 'era': ['Old_Republic_era'], 'es': ['Exar Kun'], 'eyes': ['Gray'], 'fi': ['Exar Kun'], 'fr': ['Exar Kun'], 'gender': ['Sexes/Legends'], 'hair': ['Color/Legends'], 'height': ['1.9'], 'it': ['Exar Kun'], 'ja': ['エグザ・キューン'], 'label': ['Exar Kun'], 'masters': ['Vodo-Siosk_Baas', 'Freedon_Nadd'], 'name': ['Exar Kun'], 'nl': ['Exar Kun'], 'pl': ['Exar Kun'], 'pt': ['Exar Kun'], 'ru': ['Экзар Кун'], 'skin': ['Light_side_of_the_Force/Legends'], 'species': ['Human/Legends'], 'subject': ['Category:Force_ghosts', 'Category:Sith_sorcerers', 'Category:Humans', 'Category:Sith_alchemists', 'Category:Members_of_the_Sith_Brotherhood', 'Category:Pre-Ruusan_Jedi_trainees', 'Category:Males', 'Category:Fallen_Jedi', 'Category:Treasure_keepers', 'Category:Impersonators', 'Category:Dark_Lords_of_the_Sith', 'Category:Sith_Masters', 'Category:Jedi_Guardians'], 'title': ['Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith/Legends', 'Ulic_Qel-Droma'], 'tr': ['Exar Kun'], 'type': ['Sith/Legends', 'character'], 'years': ['3997']}\n",

      "http://starwars.wikia.com/HK-47\n",
      "{'abstract': [\"HK-47 was a Hunter-Killer assassin droid and Jedi hunter constructed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Revan, shortly after the end of the Mandalorian Wars in 3960 BBY. In the wake of widespread destruction caused by the Mass Shadow Generator, a superweapon used during the final battle of that conflict, Revan was inspired to seek more subtle methods of defeating his enemies. HK-47 was sent throughout the galaxy on his missions and successfully assassinated countless targets whom Revan had deemed threats to galactic stability and peace. However, HK-47 was badly crippled and captured on a mission in Mandalorian space shortly before Revan himself was captured by the Jedi Order.As per protocol with Sith assassin droids prior to going on missions, HK-47's memory core was wiped of all knowledge of his original master. His memory could only be restored upon fulfilling his mission, and successfully returning to his master. As he never managed to return to his master, the automatic recall function was never activated, and he couldn’t remember Revan. He went from owner to owner, many of whom he inadvertently slew personally. Eventually, he ended up on the planet Tatooine, where he was sold to and unwittingly reunited with Revan, whose memory had been erased following his capture. The droid went on to aid Revan after his return to the Jedi Order in his campaign to find and destroy the Star Forge, an ancient factory that Revan had used during his reign as the Dark Lord of the Sith. HK-47 was also instrumental in the defeat of Revan's former Sith apprentice, who had since begun utilizing the Star Forge in an attempt to conquer the Galactic Republic.HK-47 accompanied Revan to the edge of the Unknown Regions along with Revan's utility droid, T3-M4, before being left behind in Revan's starship, the Ebon Hawk, as the redeemed Jedi Knight journeyed on to face a threat he had remembered from his time as the Dark Lord. Sometime later, HK-47 was damaged and was left aboard the Ebon Hawk, which eventually ended up in the hands of one of Revan's allies from the Mandalorian Wars, Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile. During this period, HK-50 assassin droids, a newer version of HK that G0-T0 had mass-produced, became active in the galaxy, working as bounty hunters and saboteurs. Surik repaired HK-47, who recognized her as his new master and accompanied her in order to find the source of the HK-50s, whose very existence he considered an insult to himself. HK-47 also aided Surik in her search for the Jedi Masters who survived the First Jedi Purge and even advised her on techniques to more efficiently kill Jedi so that Surik could better defend herself.HK-47 eventually succeeded in finding the HK Manufacturing Plant, where the HK-50s were created. There, he convinced the HK-50s to join his and Surik's cause. This action eventually culminated in a final confrontation on Malachor V between HK-47, assisted by the HK-50s, and G0-T0, whose interests conflicted with that of Surik, and the latter droid was destroyed. After his time with Surik, HK-47 set out on his own to attempt to find Revan, his original master, not knowing that Revan had since been captured by the Sith Empire and was being held in stasis. Three hundred years later, HK-47 was found by a returned Revan and aided him in commanding the Rakatan Foundry, and though he was destroyed, the rogue intelligence operative known as the Shroud copied the droid and saw to it that several versions of HK-47 were active over the following years with different masters.Four millennia later, HK-47 was found on the planet Mustafar, where his memory core was preserved within the computer of a derelict starship. HK-47 manipulated a group of spacers who discovered him, having them create a new body for him and then subsequently turning on them with the help of several battle droids. The spacers were forced to disable HK-47's new droid army as well as the factory producing them. After a fierce battle, the spacers triumphed over the droids, although HK-47 managed to escape destruction.\"], 'affiliation': ['New_Empire', 'Mandalorian_Neo-Crusaders/Legends', 'Hutt/Legends', 'Sith_Empire_(Jedi_Civil_War)', 'Meetra_Surik', 'Darth_Malgus', 'Revan', 'Systech_Corporation'], 'altLabel': ['HK 47', 'HK47', 'HK-47'], 'archivedate': ['20111124014416'], 'armament': ['Integrated modular weapon mounts'], 'birth': ['3959'], 'cardname': ['HK-47 Statuette', 'HK Droid Series Poster', 'HK-47 Mustafar Diorama'], 'class': ['Protocol_droid/Legends', 'Assassin_droid/Legends'], 'creator': ['Revan'], 'cs': ['HK-47'], 'de': ['HK-47#legends'], 'death': ['3642', '3638_BBY', '3641'], 'equipment': ['Droid_Assassin%27s_rifle', 'Blaster_rifle/Legends'], 'era': ['Rebellion_era', 'Old_Republic_era'], 'es': ['HK-47'], 'fr': ['HK-47'], 'gender': ['Sexes/Legends'], 'height': ['1.8'], 'int': ['HK-47: An Expanded Universe Character'], 'it': ['HK-47'], 'label': ['HK-47'], 'line': ['HK-series_assassin_droid'], 'link': ['TLCBADHK47.asp'], 'model': ['HK-47'], 'name': ['HK-47'], 'pack': ['HK-47'], 'pl': ['HK-47'], 'plating': ['Rusty red'], 'pt': ['Legends:HK-47'], 'ru': ['HK-47'], 'sensor': ['Color/Legends'], 'set': ['Star_Wars:_The_Legacy_Collection', \"The Nightsister's Revenge\"], 'subject': ['Category:Sith_military_personnel', 'Category:Masculine_programming', 'Category:Bounty_hunters', 'Category:Jedi_hunters', 'Category:Protocol_droids', 'Category:HK-series_assassin_droids'], 'text': ['HK-47: An Expanded Universe Character from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic', '5', 'Exploring Mustafar', 'Star Wars and the Outcasts: The Best Scoundrels in Star Wars Games'], 'type': ['droid'], 'uk': ['HK-47'], 'url': ['default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20040105hk47', 'news/star-wars-and-the-outcasts-the-best-scoundrels-in-star-wars-games', 'en_US/players/content.vm?page=Exploring%20Mustafar&resource=features', 'news/5-of-the-meanest-droids-in-star-wars']}\n",

      "{'abstract': [\"A Jedi was a member of the Jedi Order, an ancient order of protectors united by their ability to harness the power of the Force. Adhering to a doctrine that favored the light side of the Force, the Jedi aspired to attain a state of inner tranquility through calmness and meditation while avoiding emotions affiliated with the dark side of the Force, such as anger and hatred. Nevertheless, Jedi philosophy did not forbid a Jedi from acting in self-defense or in the defense of others. To that end, the weapon of a Jedi was the lightsaber, a blade composed of pure energy and different colors such as blue or green.Before the time of the Galactic Empire, a Jedi was a guardian of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. The Jedi's commitment to peace and democracy brought them into conflict with an order of dark side wielders known as the Sith, who sought power and dominion over the galaxy. Emerging victorious from their wars with the ancient Sith, the Jedi carried on in their duty as peacekeepers for over a millennium until the advent of the Clone Wars twenty-two years before the Battle of Yavin. Faced with a pan-galactic civil war between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Jedi adopted the mantle of generals and soldiers in the Grand Army of the Republic. After three years of conflict, the Jedi discovered that the war had been a ploy designed to restore the Sith to power. However, the Jedi were betrayed by one of their own—the Chosen One Anakin Skywalker, who had been seduced to the dark side and anointed Darth Vader by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Using the Jedi's own clone troopers to initiate a systematic purge of the Jedi Order, the Lords of the Sith all but eradicated the Jedi in one fell swoop, reducing the order from thousands of Jedi Knights to a handful of survivors who dispersed into exile across the galaxy.The Sith ruled the galaxy through the Empire for a generation, but did not succeed in completely wiping out the Jedi Order. As a result, Ezra Bridger and Luke Skywalker were, in turn, trained as new Jedi by Padawan Kanan Jarrus and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, respectively. Skywalker, the son of Vader, was also taught the ways of the Jedi by Grand Master Yoda. On his deathbed, Yoda gave his final apprentice the mandate of passing on his lessons to a new generation of Jedi. Shortly afterward, Skywalker succeeded in redeeming his father, who killed his Sith Master at the cost of his own life, thereby destroying the Sith and fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One.During the era of the New Republic, Skywalker worked to rebuild the Jedi Order by training a dozen apprentices, including his young but powerful nephew, Ben Solo. As before, the Jedi Order was once again betrayed from within. Solo turned to the dark side like his grandfather before him, killing half of his uncle's students and taking the rest with him into the service of Snoke, the Supreme Leader of the First Order. Skywalker survived the massacre, but blamed himself for the actions of his sister's son, who became Kylo Ren—Snoke's apprentice and master of the Knights of Ren. Forsaking the legacy of the Jedi, Skywalker exiled himself to the remote planet of Ahch-To, the birthplace of the Jedi Order, where he intended to live out his remaining days as a hermit before ultimately dying as the last Jedi. His isolation was interrupted by Rey, a Jakku scavenger who possessed raw strength in the Force like the former Ben Solo. Challenging Skywalker's views on the Jedi as symbols of failure and hubris, Rey believed that the Jedi Order had to be fully restored in order to return the galaxy to a state of peace and balance. Ultimately, Skywalker passed on the Jedi teachings to Rey and declared that he would not be the last Jedi moments before becoming one with the Force.\"], 'affiliated': ['Galactic_Republic', 'Ordu_Aspectu', 'Jedi_pilgrims', 'Alliance_to_Restore_the_Republic', 'Jedi_Crusader', 'Spectres', 'New_Republic', 'Old_Republic', 'Resistance'], 'altLabel': ['Jedis', 'Jedi/Canon', 'Jedi'], 'artifacts': ['Lothal_Jedi_Temple_key_stone', 'Jedi_Crusader_pendant', 'Lothal_Key_Stone', 'Jedi_holocron'], 'bg': ['Джедай'], 'cs': ['Jedi'], 'de': ['Jedi#kanon'], 'deities': ['Light_side_of_the_Force', 'Chosen_One', 'The_Force'], 'el': ['Τζεντάι'], 'es': ['Jedi'], 'founding': ['Battle_of_Yavin'], 'fr': ['Jedi'], 'headquarters': ['Imperial_Palace'], 'hr': ['Jedi'], 'hu': ['Jedik'], 'it': ['Jedi'], 'ja': ['ジェダイ'], 'ka': ['ჯედაი'], 'label': ['Jedi'], 'members': ['Luke_Skywalker', 'Obi-Wan_Kenobi', 'Yoda', 'Ezra_Bridger', 'Rey', 'Mace_Windu', 'Anakin_Skywalker'], 'name': ['Jedi'], 'organizations': ['Jedi_Order'], 'pl': ['Jedi'], 'pt': ['Jedi'], 'ro': ['Jedi'], 'ru': ['Джедай'], 'subject': ['Category:Jedi'], 'sv': ['Jedi'], 'text': ['Jedi_Code'], 'tr': ['Jedi'], 'type': ['religion'], 'uk': ['Джедаї'], 'zh': ['絕地']}\n",

The local pirate Nym, operating out of a base on Lok, fought back against the Federation, though in the process was forced to abandon his outpost to the enemy. Nym continued to battle the Federation for control of the Karthakk system for the next ten years, and, with the help of Adi Gallia, eventually seized his base back from the droid forces. After this event, Adi Gallia was appointed as Nym's Personal Jedi Advisor of the Karthakk System to help stabilize the inhabitants of Maramere and Lok from the Trade Federation's occupation.During the Clone Wars, the Karthakk system became a battleground once more. Aboard Drama Korr's space yacht above Maramere, Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker fought against the bounty hunter Durge. After an arduous duel, Anakin trapped Durge inside an escape pod, and blasted him into the system's star, Karthakk.In the early years of the Galactic Empire, the Tantive IV was performing test launches of its escape pods in the Karthakk system when the pirate group Lok Revenants attacked, forcing the consular ship to abandon its pods as it fled.

Upon first landing on the planet, visitors may note with dismay the small planetary map that appears. From this initial glimpse, one might assume Kashyyyk no larger than one-twentieth the size of a standard planet, when this is not the case. Kashyyyk is split up into multiple zones, such as Kachirho, the Etyyy Hunting Grounds, the Rryatt Trail, each with its own map and unique temperament. The zones are of varying difficulty, as well; Kachirho, the player\\'s starting location, is a generally friendly place with peaceful animals, while places like the Rryatt Trail are more dangerous.In addition to having a different layout from the other planets, Kashyyyk also differes from the original planets because it has large expanses of \"blocked\" land that can not be traversed by the player. This means that most gameplay is confined to the given trail, and players can not take shortcuts through more rugged terrain.The entire planet can be considered a giant theme park, as nearly every NPC you run into on the surface will be involved in quests of some kind. Many quests involve the native Wookiee populations and their attempts to free themselves from Trandoshan slave clans. Others allow the player to help the small Zssik clan overthrow the Blackscale clan as the ruling Trandoshan force on the planet, in the process destroying the Blackscale Avatar Platform space station. Rodian hunters also make a significant appearance on Kashyyyk, as do Chiss poachers attempting to ruin the Rodian expedition.Players will find a myriad of rewards from Kashyyyk quests, from paintings of the Clone Wars to unique weapons to several new starfighters to new mounts.Upon landing on Kashyyyk, players will be placed in the city of Kachirho. From this city they can venture to Etyyy (the Rodian Hunting Grounds), the Rryatt Trail, the mysterious Kkowir Forest (home to the Myyydril Caverns), or the Blackscale Slaver Compound.Because each zone is distinct from the others, POI listings will occur on individual zone pages.Kashyyyk is a completely no-build planet.

Morven carefully studied the offer but didn\\'t seem willing to trust the Hutt (\"I\\'ll review this, but I\\'d rather carry him than trust him.\").A short time later he learned from one of his informants that the Naboo security forces were looking for Borvo\\'s spice refineries. As Morven knew the location of one of those refineries, he didn\\'t hesitate to use this information to deal Borvo\\'s business a blow and quickly tasked the spacer with delivering a datadisk containing the location to one of the Security Force officers. But soon after the spacer had returned, Morven learned that RSF had started to look for his own refineries too. He didn\\'t waste any time and immediately ordered the location to be evacuated. To slow the security force\\'s search down long enough, the criminal made a deal with security officer Dagrus Rhine, who had been \"cooperative\" in the past. After the spacer delivered a datadisc containing the authorization codes to Rhine, Morven managed to evacuate the spice refinery in time before the RSF discovered it.In the time following these events, rumors started to surface that Borvo was planning something new.

It was built by Massassi slaves during the Dark Lord Exar Kun's reign in 3997 BBY. He also kept the Golden Globe—a globular device which imprisoned the souls of the children of the Massassi—in a sealed chamber.During the last centuries of the Galactic Republic, the Kushiban Jedi Master Ikrit came to the Palace and discovered the Golden Globe. Knowing that he was unable to free the trapped souls, he placed himself in a Force trance to wait the arrival of those who would break the curse.By the time of the Galactic Civil War, it had been reduced to a crumbling ruin and was discovered by the Sullustan naturalist Dr'uun Unnh. He gave the temple its name because he found a pack of woolamanders in the temple during his exploration. These creatures raised a loud, howling alarm when he entered and chased him away by pelting the Sullustan. Due to this and the fact that it was crumbling and falling apart, D'ruun Unnh deemed that the palace held little interest. Around 1 ABY, a year after the Battle of Yavin, there were reported sightings of various members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, or at the very least affiliates of the group, operating from within the ruins of the palace from time to time, acting as one of the few Rebel bases on the moon since the Rebels were driven out by the Empire, which acted as the reason why it was singled out as one of three possible locations of a prisoner transfer log that Colonel Darkstone dispatched an Imperial unit to retrieve in an attempt to rescue Doctor Bledsoe, the others being the Mokk Stronghold on Dantooine and the Droid Engineer cave on Lok.In 4 ABY, Yavin IV was made the temporary capital of the New Republic. The palace became the temporary home for the Senate Planetary Intelligence Network, a secret New Republic organization led by Mon Mothma. They presumably rebuilt parts of the palace, to make it more habitable.In 22 ABY, Jedi trainees Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila discovered the Palace of the Woolamander during a trek of the jungle surrounding the Jedi Praxeum. They discovered the Golden Globe and Ikrit though they were also unable to break it at first.Later, during a trip to nearby Yavin 8, the two Jedi discovered ancient carvings within a deep cave indicating its origins. However, before they could do this, the pair had to undergo a test in the deserts of Tatooine.

He used to be the best surgeon for 10 parsecs around Corellia, but had to stop when he could no longer deal with his nerves.Sometime during the Galactic Civil War, Herm contacted an individual who had just finished a mission given to him by C-3PO to give a comlink to 'Klee. This was because the company 'Klee was working for was secretly being funded by the Galactic Empire, and the comlink would allow any special information to the Rebellion. When the individual had delivered the comm and returned to Herm, he was rewarded with 200 credits.Sometime after this, Herm was contacted by 'Klee who informed him that a secret compound was being delivered to his research facility. He was informed that the compound would be able to make the Imperial probe droids far more quiet so they weren't as easily detectable due to their loud whine and chatter. He once again contacted the individual who had delivered the comm, and tasked them with intercepting this compound while it was being delivered by Sergeant Montage. The individual managed to kill both Montage and his two stormtrooper escorts and retrieved the compound, returning it to Herm and earning 250 credits.Herm was once again contacted by 'Klee, this time being informed that without the compound, which was apparently quite expensive in its prototype form, the Empire was considering putting an end to the project. Both he and 'Klee made a plan to stop the project altogether, again requiring the individuals help. Herm informed the individual that he had to meet with the Imperial Officer who was overseeing the project, a Captain Sargon, and get the blueprints for the new probe droids. The individual managed to do this by killing both Sargon and his stormtrooper escort, and gave the documents to Herm who in turn gave them to the Alliance High Command.Unfortunately, some time after this, the Imperials found 'Klee's comlink and, learning of his betrayal, had him arrested and sentenced to death. For the final time, Herm asked for the individual's help in freeing 'Klee from Imperial captivity. He gave the individual 'Klee's last known co-ordinates and asked him to hurry. Fortunately, the individual managed to free 'Klee and brought him back to Herm just in time for Herm to save his life.

Dann then made his way to the home of his Wookiee friend Chewbacca, who had not yet arrived home for the holiday, and whose family was worried about his absence.After Dann assuaged the Wookiees' fears and gave them all Life Day gifts, he reassured the Alliance's Princess Leia Organa—speaking to them via wallscreen—that the family would be safe. However, an Imperial search party entered the home on a hunt for ties to the Rebels. Dann nervously attempted to prevent the Imperials from discovering that Chewbacca, a well-known Alliance hero, was one of the home's residents, but the search party's Commander ordered him to leave. Dann later returned and found that a recently-arrived Chewbacca had eliminated a stormtrooper who had been left to guard the home, and the trader used the family's wallscreen to convince a suspicious Imperial officer that the trooper had fled his post.During another Life Day, which came at some point between 0 BBY and 3 ABY, Dann celebrated the occasion by ordering two cases of candy for children in need. When the shipment was late, he recruited a spacer to track it down, and the spacer discovered that the candy had been stolen and eaten by the stormtrooper TK-555.

He began his career in the organization of Jorj Car'das, where he moved quickly through the ranks to become one of Car'das's top lieutenants. When Car'das disappeared in 0 BBY, Karrde quickly and quietly took over the organization to avoid internal feuding. The smuggling and information-brokering organization was already formidable, and when Jabba Desilijic Tiure was killed in 4 ABY, Karrde was able to pick up the most pieces and guide his group to the top spot in the smuggling world. Known as an honest and honorable man, Karrde kept a low profile despite his lofty underworld position.In 9 ABY, Karrde was drawn into the Galactic Civil War, in which he had previously avoided taking sides, when he rescued Luke Skywalker from being stranded in deep space and helped Skywalker avoid capture by Imperial leader Grand Admiral Thrawn, though only after his hand was forced. Thrawn placed a bounty on Karrde, driving him to sell the location of the Katana fleet, a secret he had kept since his days in Car'das's employ, to the New Republic. Karrde then organized the Smugglers' Alliance to represent the smugglers to the New Republic and aid in the battle against Thrawn. When Thrawn was defeated, Karrde remained a valued ally of Skywalker and the Solos but was not trusted by the New Republic leadership as a whole due to his shady past.In 19 ABY, Karrde undertook a mission to find Car'das, whose retribution he had long feared, in order to seek out a copy of the Caamas Document and end the political crisis regarding it. Car'das did not have a copy, but did provide information that was key in exposing the hoax regarding Thrawn's return. In the aftermath of the peace treaty between the New Republic and Imperial Remnant, Karrde turned his organization into an information-sharing agency to maintain trust between the two governments. He lost his valued second-in-command, Mara Jade, in the process as she married Skywalker and took up the Jedi life. When the Yuuzhan Vong invaded six years later, Karrde revived the Smugglers' Alliance to combat the Yuuzhan Vong and played a key role, in partnership with Lando Calrissian and longtime friend Booster Terrik, in helping pro-Jedi Chief of State candidate Cal Omas be elected to office during the crisis. When the Jedi were declared enemies of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances in 40 ABY, Karrde put his organization at their disposal, having become a staunch ally of the Jedi in contrast to his previous desire for neutrality.\"], 'affiliation': ['Jedi_Coalition', 'Car%27das', 'Smugglers%27_Alliance', 'Galactic_Federation_of_Free_Alliances', 'New_Republic/Legends'], 'altLabel': ['Talon Kardde', 'Talon Kaarde', 'Captain Karrde', 'Chieftain Karrde', 'Karrde', 'Talon Karrde'], 'birth': ['31_BBY/Legends'], 'content': ['Jade_Solitaire', 'Star_Wars:_Rebellion_(video_game)', 'Fate_of_the_Jedi:_Omen', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Agents_of_Chaos_II:_Jedi_Eclipse', 'X-Wing:_The_Bacta_War', 'Survivor%27s_Quest', 'Specter_of_the_Past', 'Simple_Tricks', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Balance_Point', 'Shield_of_Lies', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Vector_Prime', 'I,_Jedi', 'Champions_of_the_Force', 'Darksaber_(novel)', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Enemy_Lines_I:_Rebel_Dream', 'Dark_Force_Rising_(comics)', 'Star_Wars:_Empire_at_War:_Forces_of_Corruption', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Edge_of_Victory_I:_Conquest', 'X-Wing:_Isard%27s_Revenge', 'Emissary_of_the_Void', 'Heir_to_the_Empire_(comics)', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Enemy_Lines_II:_Rebel_Stand', 'The_Last_Command', 'Vision_of_the_Future', 'The_New_Rebellion', 'Star_Wars:_X-Wing_Alliance', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Destiny%27s_Way', 'Choices_of_One', 'Dark_Force_Rising', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Edge_of_Victory_II:_Rebirth', 'Legacy_of_the_Force:_Betrayal', 'Heir_to_the_Empire', 'Dark_Apprentice_(novel)', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Star_by_Star', 'X-Wing_Rogue_Squadron_2:_The_Rebel_Opposition,_Part_2', 'Star_Wars:_Jedi_Knight:_Mysteries_of_the_Sith', 'Star_Wars:_Union', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Force_Heretic_II:_Refugee', 'Star_Wars:_Galactic_Battlegrounds', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Dark_Journey', 'Fate_of_the_Jedi:_Outcast', 'Dark_Nest_III:_The_Swarm_War', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Dark_Tide_II:_Ruin', 'The_Last_Command_(comics)', 'Jedi_Search', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_The_Unifying_Force', 'Legacy_of_the_Force:_Fury'], 'cs': ['Talon Karrde'], 'de': ['Talon Karrde#legends'], 'defa': ['1'], 'era': ['Legacy_era', 'New_Jedi_Order_era', 'New_Republic_era', 'Rebellion_era', 'Rise_of_the_Empire_era'], 'eyes': ['Light blue'], 'fr': ['Talon Karrde'], 'gender': ['Sexes/Legends'], 'hair': ['Black'], 'height': ['1.7'], 'ja': ['タロン・カード'], 'label': ['Talon Karrde'], 'name': ['Talon Karrde'], 'pl': ['Talon Karrde'], 'plfa': ['1'], 'pt': ['Talon Karrde'], 'ru': ['Тэлон_Каррде'], 'skin': ['Fair'], 'species': ['Human/Legends'], 'subject': ['Category:Humans', 'Category:Crime_lords', 'Category:Business_owners_and_executives', 'Category:Car%27das_members', 'Category:Males', 'Category:New_Republic_individuals', 'Category:Pilots', 'Category:Information_brokers', 'Category:Bureaucrats', 'Category:Smugglers%27_Alliance_members', 'Category:Authors', 'Category:Jedi_Coalition_personnel'], 'type': ['GFFA', 'character'], 'width': ['100.0']}\n",

From there, players were started on the Legacy Quests. This means that Tatooine is generally one of the most populated planets in Star Wars Galaxies.The planet is a large desert almost completely covered in sand. Landscape varies from mountains and valleys in the Jundland Wastes to rolling endless rolling sand in the East and West Dune Seas. Despite the hot, arrid conditions, the planet has multiple major cities, forms of entertainment and adventures.A popular grinding method is partaking in Squill Hunts, where a group- usually consisting of one of two advanced combat novices and ten or twelve lower-classed starter profession wielders- takes the financially rewarding Mountain Squill missions in order to quickly gain experience. Through personal experience, I have found this to be a far superior method for beginners to grinding alone.Another moneymaker for the high-level masters is Krayt-Hunting. Krayt Dragons are tremendous creatures who occasionally drop pearls and tissues of various rarities used Weapon Making, Slicing, and in Lightsabers. Krayt-Hunting is an enjoyed activity of Combat Masters or their equivalents.

As a result, many residents of the planet instead drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had no vegetation.Initially inhabited by native Jawa and Tusken Raider species, it saw a population explosion following the search for valuable mining deposits on the planet's silicate surface. Finding the ore to have unwanted metallurgic properties, mining firms left the planet en masse, leaving behind valuable equipment, most notably large sandcrawlers, which were later used by the Jawa population.The Hutt Clan also maintained a presence on Tatooine, with Jabba the Hutt owning a palace in the desert at least by the time of the Clone Wars until his death shortly before the Battle of Endor.Largely ignored by the galaxy at large, Tatooine gained the notice of the Empire during the Galactic Civil War when an escape pod carrying two droids in possession of top-secret information launched from the starship Tantive IV and landed on the sandy Outer Rim world.\"], 'affiliation': ['Galactic_Empire', 'Hutt_Clan'], 'altLabel': ['Tattooine', 'Tatooine/Canon', 'Tatooine'], 'atmosphere': ['Atmosphere'], 'bg': ['Татуин'], 'cities': ['Mos_Taike', 'Freetown', 'Mos_Eisley', 'Mos_Elrey', 'Mos_Entha', 'Bestine_(city)', 'Anchorhead', 'Tosche_Station', 'Mos_Doba', 'Mos_Espa'], 'class': ['Terrestrial'], 'climate': ['Hot and arid'], 'coord': ['Standard_Galactic_Grid'], 'da': ['Tatooine'], 'de': ['Tatooine#kanon'], 'diameter': ['10465.0'], 'distance': ['43000'], 'el': ['Τατουίν'], 'es': ['Tatooine'], 'exports': ['Silicax_oxalate', 'Slavery', 'Dilarium_oil'], 'fauna': ['Rancor', 'Rock_wart', 'Gorg', 'Bantha', 'Greater_krayt_dragon', 'Jerba', 'Canyon_krayt_dragon', 'Scurrier', 'Eopie', 'Sarlacc', 'Massiff', 'Sandfly', 'Ronto', 'Dune_worm', 'Worrt', 'Dewback', 'Womp_rat'], 'flora': ['Lamta', 'Black_melon', 'Funnel_flower', 'Poonten_grass', 'Tuber', 'Pallie', 'Polta_bean'], 'fr': ['Tatooine'], 'hr': ['Tatooine'], 'hu': ['Tatooine'], 'interest': ['Anchorhead_Pass', 'Northern_Dune_Sea', 'Western_Dune_Sea', 'Great_Pit_of_Carkoon', 'Beggar%27s_Canyon', 'Jabba%27s_Palace', 'Xelric_Draw', 'Great_Mesra_Plateau', 'Jundland_Wastes', 'Jundland_Chasm', 'Great_Chott_salt_flat', 'Dune_Sea'], 'it': ['Tatooine'], 'ja': ['タトゥイーン'], 'ka': ['ტატუინი'], 'ko': ['타투인'], 'label': ['Tatooine'], 'language': ['Galactic_Basic', 'Bocce', 'Jawaese', 'Tusken', 'Huttese'], 'lengthyear': ['304'], 'moons': ['Chenini', 'Ghomrassen', '3', 'Guermessa'], 'name': ['Tatooine'], 'nl': ['Tatooine'], 'no': ['Tatooine'], 'otherspecies': ['Stennes_Shifter', 'Siniteen', 'Quarren', 'Er%27Kit_(species)', 'Pacithhip', 'Weequay', 'Duros', 'Bith', 'Nikto', 'Human', 'Aqualish', 'Klatooinian', 'Lutrillian', 'Morseerian', 'Advozse', 'Twi%27lek', 'Talz', 'Arcona', 'Hutt', 'Gamorrean', 'Rodian', 'Toydarian', 'Defel', 'Ishi_Tib', 'Dug'], 'pl': ['Tatooine'], 'population': ['200000'], 'pt': ['Tatooine'], 'region': ['Outer_Rim_Territories'], 'ro': ['Tatooine\\u200e\\u200e'], 'ru': ['Татуин/Канон'], 'sector': ['Arkanis_sector'], 'species': ['Tusken_Raider', 'Jawa'], 'subject': ['Category:Galactic_Empire_planets', 'Category:Tatooine_locations', 'Category:Desert_planets', 'Category:Arkanis_sector_planets'], 'suns': ['Tatoo_II', '2', 'Tatoo_I'], 'sv': ['Tatooine'], 'system': ['Tatoo_system'], 'terrain': ['Desert'], 'type': ['planet'], 'uk': ['Татуїн'], 'water': ['1.0'], 'zh': ['塔圖因']}\n",

The Force was generated by all living entities, and therefore, resided in all lifeforms. It was especially powerful in a select group of individuals who were born with a high concentration of midi-chlorians—microscopic, sentient lifeforms that shared a symbiotic relationship with the Force—in their blood. These people were deemed Force-sensitive, making them capable of harnessing the various powers of the Force. Unlike organic beings, droids and other artificial constructs existed outside of the Force. As such, they possessed no connection to the energy field that was created and sustained by life. Apart from its scientific aspect, the Force was the basis of various religious organizations such as the Church of the Force, the Guardians of the Whills, and most notably the Jedi Order and the Sith Order. In addition, the Lasats believed that the Force was the \"spirit\" of the galaxy.The Force as a recorded concept existed for well over twenty-five thousand years. There were multiple aspects of the Force. The Living Force was fueled by the energies of all lifeforms and, in turn, fed into the Cosmic Force—the Force that bound everything together and communicated through the midi-chlorians. A certain aspect of the Force was referred to as stonepower; its power was derived from a blue stone imbued with the Living Force. The Jedi Order followed a code of selflessness and service to others; therefore, they adhered to the light side of the Force. Their adversaries, the Sith, coveted strength and power through the dark side of the Force.

Charrics, while accurate, had shorter ranges than blasters, especially the handgun models. The charric handgun had a power pack that had to be replaced after forty shots and had an effective range of eight meters.Although the Republic at large did not know of the Chiss until the Imperial Era, the charric could still be found on Republic worlds as early as 3951 BBY, such as Onderon.'], 'altLabel': ['Charrik', 'Charric'], 'label': ['Charric'], 'subject': ['Category:Chiss_weapons', 'Category:Rifles', 'Category:Maser_weaponry', 'Category:Carbines'], 'type': ['eras']}\n",

They were produced by a combination of the extreme pressures present in the atmosphere of Yavin Prime—pressures great enough to crush elements together—and the scraping of the liquefied air of the planet against its metallic core. The sizes of Corusca gems increased with proximity to the core of Yavin. They could be found only in very select locations in the galaxy, and their vibrancy resulted in them becoming the namesake of the galactic capital: Coruscant. The Corusca Gem casino was also named after these gems.Corusca gems were mostly valued for their beauty. The way that light reflected inside a Corusca gem would make it seem as if it had a furnace within it. As a result, there were many Corusca gem fisherman, such as Bash Fateau, who made a living out of collecting the gems.Corusca gems were some of the hardest objects known to the galaxy, and had industrial as well as decorative applications. Large Corusca gems were mounted on drills and used for precision drilling when explosives could not be used.Despite their well known strength, Corusca gems had shatterpoints, minuscule points where multiple edges and facets would come together, forming an extremely weak spot. If delivered at exactly the right point, and exactly the right way, the slightest tap could cause the entire gem to crumble.Supreme Chancellor Palpatine once tempted Anakin Skywalker with a bag of Corusca gems as an example of how he could have anything he wanted, if only he were to ask for it. Skywalker, however, was not interested, as the only thing he truly wanted at the time was to prevent the death of his wife, Padmé Amidala, which he had seen prophesied in a Force vision.Jacen Solo used a Corusca gem worth the price of an entire Coruscant city block, which he acquired at GemDiver Station, Lando Calrissian's mining station, to power his lightsaber.

The observance of Empire Day began in 19 BBY, when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine proclaimed the Clone Wars to be over and reorganized the Galactic Republic into the First Galactic Empire via the Declaration of a New Order. In his declaration, Palpatine mandated that Imperial citizens would celebrate the anniversary of Empire's creation yearly, for the sake of posterity. Although the first Empire Day was marked by several attempts by Jedi to dismantle the Empire, the new government and the tradition lived on. When the rebellious Alliance to Restore the Republic formed in 2 BBY, its members protested the celebration of Empire Day. In a symbolic show of solidarity with the Old Republic, the Alliance began celebrating Remembrance Day on the same date as the Empire's galactic holiday. During the Galactic Civil War, both the Empire and the Alliance ramped up propaganda efforts to promote the observation of the respective holidays.Empire Day was celebrated in a number of different ways, depending on region and culture. Although the holiday fell on one specific day of the year, celebrations in some corners of the Empire continued for weeks. An example of such jubilation could be found on Naboo, where the capital city of Theed played host to Imperial Military parades and statues of Emperor Palpatine for days on end. During this time, the Empire would provide loyal citizens with goods that promoted state pride, such as food rations and artwork.\"], 'altLabel': ['Empire Day/Legends'], 'archivedate': ['20111124011353'], 'celebrations': [\"Celebrated throughout the Empire's domain an a wide variety of ways\"], 'conc': ['Remembrance_Day'], 'date': ['23'], 'de': ['Tag des Imperiums#legends'], 'es': ['Día del Imperio'], 'label': ['Empire Day/Legends'], 'name': ['Empire_Day/Legends'], 'nl': ['Empire_Day/Legends'], 'observances': ['Private celebrations with friends and family', 'Palpatine/Legends', 'Imperial_Military/Legends', 'Imperial pride goods are traded and utilized'], 'observedby': ['Galactic_Empire/Legends'], 'pl': ['Dzień Imperium'], 'place': ['Imperial space'], 'ru': ['День Империи'], 'scenario': ['Empire Day promotional scenario'], 'set': ['Galactic Hunters'], 'significance': ['Declaration_of_a_New_Order', 'Reaffirmation of Imperial patriotism and duty'], 'subject': ['Category:Galactic_Empire_holidays'], 'sv': ['Imperiumdagen'], 'text': ['Empire_Day/Legends'], 'type': ['holiday'], 'url': ['players/news_archive.vm?id=67814&month=062008']}\n",

      "{'abstract': ['A homing beacon, homing device, tracer, tracer beacon, tracking device, or pulsing beacon was used to track starships or any other entity being transported. Capable of transmitting data enormous distances, homing beacons could relay the position of a ship even after several hyperspace jumps.Imperial beacons (and, presumably, ones used by the Galactic Republic) used non-mass HoloNet transceivers located in hyperspatial \"S-threads\" to track ships through hyperspace. When a homing beacon passed a transceiver, the incident was logged; allowing trackers to determine the heading of a vessel from a collection of these reports.Many homing beacons were miniaturized, so as to prevent detection by the crew of the ship being tracked. As such, they could be hidden either inside of the ship or tucked in some crevice on the ship\\'s exterior; in fact, some beacon models were small enough to be thrown towards a departing ship\\'s hull.Obi-Wan Kenobi used such a device on Slave I in order to track Jango Fett to Geonosis just prior to the start of the Clone Wars. Around 3 ABY, IG-88B used a set of ultra-small microtracers to track Boba Fett, Dengar, Bossk, Zuckuss, 4-LOM and their ships, in an attempt to have them do the work of tracking down Han Solo for him.Grand Master Yoda also used a homing beacon to be tracked by Bail Organa and escape from Palpatine and his shock troopers in Coruscant.The Empire also used a similar device to track the Millennium Falcon in order to discover the location of the hidden Rebel base on Yavin 4. The beacon was planted aboard the Falcon by a HMOR homing droid.Drooim-Durtha Systems was a corporation, specializing in the development and manufacturing of tracking devices.Homing beacons can also be used in an offensive manner, as evidenced by the Heinsnake Cult using a homing beacon to have the the basis fire an energy ray to obliterate a Venator-class Star Destroyer.'], 'altLabel': ['Beacon transponder', 'Homing beacon/Legends', 'Tracking device', 'Homing device', 'Tracking beacon', 'Pulsing beacon', 'Tracer beacon'], 'archiveurl': ['https://web.archive.org/web/20180214143720/www.rebelscum.com/soteKslave1.asp'], 'cardname': ['Homing_beacon/Legends', \"IG-88's Bold Attack on Boba Fett\"], 'content': ['Tales_of_the_Jedi:_The_Golden_Age_of_the_Sith_5:_The_Flight_of_Starbreaker_12', 'Star_Wars:_Jedi_Knight:_Jedi_Academy', 'Star_Wars_Episode_II:_Attack_of_the_Clones_(junior_novelization)', 'Star_Wars_11:_Star_Search!', 'Star_Wars:_Episode_II_—_Attack_of_the_Clones', 'Legacy_of_the_Force:_Tempest', 'Star_Wars:_Episode_II_Attack_of_the_Clones', 'Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic:_Flashpoint', 'Splinter_of_the_Mind%27s_Eye', 'Star_Wars:_Episode_III_Revenge_of_the_Sith', 'Splinter_of_the_Mind%27s_Eye_1', 'Star_Wars_Journal:_The_Fight_for_Justice', 'Dark_Knight%27s_Devilry', 'Star_Wars:_Tales_of_the_Jedi_—_The_Fall_of_the_Sith_Empire', 'The_Kingdom_of_Ice!', 'Star_Wars:_Empire:_Darklighter', 'Dark_Forces:_Rebel_Agent_audio_drama', 'Legacy_of_the_Force:_Invincible', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Enemy_Lines_II:_Rebel_Stand', 'Beyond_the_Rim', 'Dark_Force_Rising', 'Star_Wars_69:_Death_in_the_City_of_Bone', 'The_Old_Republic:_Fatal_Alliance', 'Fate_of_the_Jedi:_Abyss', 'Side_Trip', 'Dark_Nest_I:_The_Joiner_King', 'Boba_Fett:_The_Fight_to_Survive', 'The_Constancia_Affair', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Edge_of_Victory_II:_Rebirth', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Force_Heretic_II:_Refugee', 'Star_Wars_Adventures_3:_The_Hostage_Princess', 'The_Isis_Coordinates', 'Legacy_of_the_Force:_Exile', 'Riptide_(novel)', 'Dark_Forces:_Rebel_Agent', 'X-Wing:_Rogue_Squadron', 'Star_Wars:_Legacy:_Trust_Issues', 'The_Clone_Wars_12:_Hero_of_the_Confederacy,_Part_3', 'Boba_Fett:_Enemy_of_the_Empire_1', 'Dark_Nest_III:_The_Swarm_War', 'The_Clone_Wars_11:_Hero_of_the_Confederacy,_Part_2', 'Young_Jedi_Knights:_The_Emperor%27s_Plague', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_The_Unifying_Force', 'Dark_Nest_II:_The_Unseen_Queen', 'Fate_of_the_Jedi:_Apocalypse', 'Legacy_of_the_Force:_Sacrifice', 'The_Life_and_Legend_of_Obi-Wan_Kenobi', 'Therefore_I_Am:_The_Tale_of_IG-88', 'Han_Solo%27s_Revenge', 'Jedi_Quest:_The_Final_Showdown', 'Fate_of_the_Jedi:_Allies', 'Crisis_on_Cloud_City', 'Star_Wars:_Episode_IV_A_New_Hope', 'The_New_Jedi_Order:_Recovery', 'Tatooine_Ghost', 'Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic', 'Scoundrel%27s_Luck', 'Lando_Calrissian_and_the_Flamewind_of_Oseon', 'Jedi_Quest:_The_Changing_of_the_Guard', 'Jedi_Quest:_The_False_Peace', 'A_Barve_Like_That:_The_Tale_of_Boba_Fett', 'Shadow_Games', 'Boba_Fett:_Enemy_of_the_Empire_2', 'Star_Wars_Adventures_2:_The_Cavern_of_Screaming_Skulls', 'Star_Wars:_Battlefront', 'X-Wing:_Wraith_Squadron', 'Hard_Merchandise', 'Fate_of_the_Jedi:_Backlash'], 'de': ['Peilsender'], 'es': ['Señal de rastreo'], 'label': ['Homing beacon/Legends'], 'link': ['http://www.rebelscum.com/photo.asp?image=/sote/soteTC089.jpg', 'soteKslave1.asp'], 'nl': ['Homing_beacon/Legends'], 'pack': [\"Boba Fett's Slave I\"], 'ru': ['Следящее устройство'], 'set': ['Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire', 'Agents of Deception'], 'subject': ['Category:Homing_beacons'], 'type': ['eras'], 'width': ['100.0']}\n",

The prevalence of assassin droids and war droids during and after the Great Sith War resulted in the creation of advanced ion weapons to combat them. Ion blasters were developed following HK-01's Great Droid Revolution, and continued to be useful weapons against mechanized forces. They were used by Galactic Republic soldiers to combat threats such as the technology-reliant Mandalorians and their droids, as well as the battle droids of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Most Ion weapons did little damage to organic enemies, though the more powerful cannons could seriously injure or kill a living creature due to the raw power of the blast. Larger cannon versions existed, for taking out threats too massive for a hand-held blaster to deal with.Ion blasters were also used during the Galactic Civil War in the form of Merr-Sonn's Destructive ElectroMagnetic Pulse and DEMP 2 guns, used by the stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire. These weapons were more dangerous to living matter than most ion weapons. Another common model of ion blaster was the ionization blaster used by the Jawas of Tatooine to capture droids for sale. Despite battle droid based armies falling out of fashion in the years following the Clone Wars, Ionization-based weaponry still saw use during the Galactic Civil War, but to a substantially lesser degree.Ion weapons ranged from small personal blasters to large rifles for heavy duty combat against droids to massive starship mounted weapons capable of disabling an enemy ship without causing damage to it. Many starfighters such as the Y-wing and B-wing carried ion weaponry for boarding operations where capturing a target was the primary objectives as the ionized target stayed undamaged apart from its electrical systems. Ion pulse missiles with ionizing warheads could also be used as they were more powerful than ion cannons and were all but guaranteed to hit the target due to their advanced guidance systems.

Upon finding them, they used them to dissipate an energy field.The Pirates of Iridium, prior to their destruction by the Jedi in 22 BBY, used these shards to great effect in their operations. By taking advantage of the gems' shield-disrupting power, they could cripple spice freighters and other spacecraft, looting their contents with little resistance. Leia, however, learned of the event from her childhood as stories her father, Bail Organa, told her.While for a time it was presumed that all power gems were destroyed with their bandit owners, one of the relics survived in the possession of the smuggler and ex-pirate Raskar. Retiring to a remote Outer Rim planet, Raskar kept the gem until a worthy foe bested him in combat. Eventually, he was trounced by a cocky smuggler and his furry companion, and was forced to relinquish control of the last power gem, the item that they were sent to retrieve by the Rebel Alliance as a last resort against the Executor.After joining the Rebel Alliance, Han Solo and Chewbacca, upon retrieving the power gem, turned their acquisition over to General Jan Dodonna immediately following the Battle of Yavin. In a futile effort to destroy the Super Star Destroyer Executor, Jan's son, Vrad, took the gem and flew skyward. The resulting event did little to disrupt the warship's shield—hardly any power was left in the gem after all the years that had passed. While the general's son failed to destroy Executor, his brave attack did buy the Alliance time to successfully evacuate the Yavin 4 base. In addition, the little amount of shielding that was disrupted nonetheless allowed the Millennium Falcon to damage one of the Executors sublight engines.Besides the power gem kept by Raskar, there were other power gems scattered across the galaxy, usually buried, which some spacers attempted to locate during the Galactic Civil War. While not as potent as to disrupt the shields of enemy vessels, they were nonetheless powerful enough to mitigate damage on its wielder, as well as enhance their ability to dodge.

These units included specialized Sith Imperial agents, clone sharpshooters, assassin droids, Rebel Marksmans, and Galactic Imperial scout troopers. Some of these snipers were equipped with recon droids for scouting and calling down orbital bombardment.

It consists of a single giant beak and many tentacles emerging from the depths of its pit as well as the spike-like teeth that help get prey caught inside the pit long enough for the tentacles to grab it. Xenobiologists are unsure as to whether the sarlacc is animal or plant, as it possesses characteristics of both kingdoms. They reproduce by spitting out a small dart like object that attaches to a living creature and the lavae that emerges from the dart devours the attached creature in some way. A Stormtrooper's dewback was the first thing Carkoon's dart pod attached to; it was pulled off when the Stormtrooper paid a Jawa to take care of it for the night.

The weapon was typically available for a cost of 250 credits.Variants of the ion pistol included the ion stunner pistol which could disable electronic devices and security doors.

Clone scout troopers of the 41st Elite Corps and Clone shadow troopers were also known to carry these weapons during the latter stages of the Clone Wars.This compact, one-handed blaster was fitted with a side-mounted targeting scope and phase amplifier, and featured a miniature gas cell on the rear. The weapon had a short-range barrel. Scout troopers commonly carried these weapons in a boot holster of their armor. Because scout troopers wore padded gloves, the pistol had a pressure-sensitive grip rather than a trigger. The trooper was able to hold the grip with two gloved fingers through the enlarged finger guard.During the time of the Galactic Civil War, at least one trader was known to possess this weapon, calling it Trader's Friend.\"], 'affiliation': ['Galactic_Empire/Legends', 'Galactic_Republic/Legends'], 'altLabel': ['Scout Trooper Blaster Pistol', 'Scout trooper blaster pistol', 'Scout blaster', \"Trader's Friend\"], 'archivedate': ['20111124013912'], 'cardname': ['Scout Blaster'], 'color': ['Black'], 'de': ['Scoutblaster#legends'], 'era': ['New_Republic_era', 'Rebellion_era', 'Rise_of_the_Empire_era'], 'label': ['Scout trooper blaster pistol'], 'link': ['VINtBikerscout.asp'], 'name': ['Scout trooper blaster pistol'], 'nl': ['EC-17 Hold-out Blaster'], 'pack': ['Biker Scout'], 'range': ['Short'], 'set': ['Endor Limited', 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'], 'subject': ['Category:Hold-out_blasters'], 'text': ['Tech Specs: Pistols', 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'], 'type': ['Hold-out_blaster/Legends', 'weapon'], 'url': ['players/content.vm?id=66928&resource=features']}\n",

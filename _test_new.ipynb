However, as much as there were similarities, there were differences. The proportion of land to water, density (5.5g), and atmosphere (78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen) were exactly like those on Earth. However, unlike Earth, the diameter at the equator (7,917 miles) and layout of the continents were different. (: \\\"\\\")\",\n",
